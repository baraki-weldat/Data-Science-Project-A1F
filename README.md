# Data Science Project A1F
### Course Objective
 The student will study a problem related to data science, and show that he/she has acquired an intellectual maturity in the field. e.g., by being able to critically evaluate different methods for data analysis. The project can be carried out in collaboration with an external organization. The work shall be carried out in connection with the research interests of the researchers at the University of Skövde and project ideas can be found under Files --> Project ideas. The student can of course pitch his/her own idea, which has to be discussed with a potential supervisor.
### EXPLAINABLE HATE SPEECH CLASSIFICATION:Comparative Analysis of BERT Variants
1. **INTRODUCTION:** In this research, the researcher studies three pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models that are used to detect hate speech and offensive language on Twitter data sets. The data set used for the study is based on real Twitter data, where sentences have been manually classified as either hate, offensive, or neither by users. The natural language processing data sets have similar patterns and characteristics which can be  reused. Training machine learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) models from scratch is a repetitive process and computationally expensive which requires adapting the previous model's knowledge and reuse in other related tasks. So, pre-trained BERT transformers are fine-tuned using the collected data sets, with less computational costs. The three models were evaluated using accuracy and f1-score performance measurement metrics.
